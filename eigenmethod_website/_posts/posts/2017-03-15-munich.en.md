The experts from EigenMethod visited the largest international conference and exhibition [MobileTech][con], which took place on March 15, 2016 in Munich, where they presented their speech “How to Accelerate Your Business Mobilization?”  

What tasks did we set ourselves when we planned to visit the exhibition? Actually, we had a set of tasks, but the main ones were:   

* to present ourselves to international community;  
* to present our speech and disclose our vision of application of mobile technologies in business;  
* to present our own mobile platform [HyperHive][hh], which is undergoing public [beta testing][eap] now until July 31, 2016;  
* •	to become acquainted with new colleagues and find potential partners and customers.  

The conference was successful and we beat the target in the tasks set.
