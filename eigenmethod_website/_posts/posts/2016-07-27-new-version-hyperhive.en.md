## Security and convenience are priorities of current release

Starting on July 22 you can get access to the HyperHive v1.0. HyperHive has several new security features:
* LDAP authentication of mobile device users,
* data transfer channel encryption (using custom algorithms),
* local data encryption on mobile devices,
* offline authentication with PIN,
* MDM integration.

HyperHive developers will appreciate following features:
* abstraction of data structures (stored in the backend systems),
* handling local data as objects (like in ORM),
* transparent authN/authZ/encryption in the framework.
