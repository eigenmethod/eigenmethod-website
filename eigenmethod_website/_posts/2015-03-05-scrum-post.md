## Scrum techniques in EigenMethod development 

##  ![](/img/posts/Scrumm.jpg)


Our team works according to Scrum techniques, where Scrum is one of the most popular techniques of flexible development. One of the reasons of its popularity is flexibility. According to the definition, Scrum is a carcass of development using which it is possible to effectively solve the arising problems producing goods of the greatest importance. 
 
When one talks about Scrum techniques, usually they mean flexible methodology of software development based on Scrum rules and practices and used in their own company. It is very likely that our Scrum differs from your Scrum, which shows that the classic Scrum techniques are adapted by each company for their needs and goals.

It is necessary to pay attention to Product and Sprint Backlog terms as they are the basis of our methodology.  

Product Backlog is a prioritized list of business requirements and technical requirements to the system available at the moment. Sprint Backlog contains functionality chosen by Product Owner from Product Backlog for the current Sprint. 
 
Our company maintains Product and Sprint Backlog in the product management system, and both cooperative team work on documentation and exchange of necessary information is carried out with the help of [Google Docs][god].  

The basis of Scrum is Sprint, in course of which the work on the project is carried out.  

In case of our Scrum, Sprint should be divided into the internal work of the team on the project and external work of management with the client.  

Internal work on the Sprint project takes 1-2 weeks. Before each sprint the team carries out planning of its activities and chooses the tasks. In course of solving the Sprint tasks the team performs Daily Scrum every day, which helps it to define the current Sprint status and progress. After the end of four-week Sprint the team presents the report on Sprint results and demonstrates a ready sample. After that, Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective are carried out, their task is to assess effectiveness (productivity) of the team in the performed Sprint and to forecast the expected effectiveness (productivity) in the next sprint.  

For the external work with the client we use release management; the work on release lasts only 2-3 months, and at the end of that work the client receives a ready and checked product performing a specific business process.
